# Storybook

We have added a Storybook configuration for the React frontend of this website that allows researchers and stakeholders to look and play around with the components that are used in the experiments.

## What is Storybook?

> Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. Thousands of teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. Itâ€™s open source and free.
