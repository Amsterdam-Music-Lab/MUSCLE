# Customizing the look of an experiment
To customize fonts and images shown during an experiment, you can add a theme. Click "Add Theme" in the left sidebar.

<img alt="Add a theme" style="height:400px" src="../assets/images/ThemeAdd.png">

This opens a form, which allows you to set a name (required) and description of the theme. These are for your own convenience: a descriptive name makes sure that you can find the theme back easily, e.g., when assigning it to an experiment. Furthermore, the form lets you enter font families, or url to fonts, for the headings and body text presented to participant, e.g., during instructions or in a questionnaire.

The form also allows you to set an image for the logo (shown top-left during an experiment) and the background image (shown behind the font: make sure to choose a dark image with (standard) light font colors). If you haven't added images to yet, you can click the "plus" symbol to add an image.

The pop-up image form provides the option to upload an image file, and fill in information on what alternative text should be displayed when the image cannot be loaded. Images can also link to external urls (`Href`), in which case the `Rel` and `Target` fields allow to determine how linking to another website should behave. Optionally, you can also assign tags to the image.

The final fields of the form are configurations for the header and footer of experiments. To display the header (currently only available in "dashboard" mode), check `Show score`. For the footer, you can add "Sponsor images",  which will be displayed horizontally below other content. This can be used to display logos of collaborators and funding agencies.
