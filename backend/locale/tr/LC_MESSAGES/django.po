"\n"
"    The Speech-to-Song Illusion is a perceptual illusion whereby the "
"repetition of a speech segment induces a perceptual\n"
"    transformation from the impression of speech to the impression of "
"signing. The present project aims at investigating\n"
"    the influence of linguistic experience upon the strength of the "
"illusion.\n"

"    The experiment will last about 10 minutes. After filling out a brief "
"questionnaire inquiring about your age, gender,\n"
"    native language(s), and experience with three languages, you will be "
"presented with short speech segments in those\n"
"    languages as well as short environmental sounds. Your task will be to "
"rate each segment on a scale from 1 to 5 in\n"
"    terms of its musicality.\n"
