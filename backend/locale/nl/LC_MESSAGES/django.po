"verzamelen. De huidige studie is daarom slechts een computertaak. Het doel "
"van deze studie is om individuele verschillen in ritmegevoel te onderzoeken. "
"Ritme is een fundamenteel aspect van muziek en muzikaliteit, maar de "
"verschillen in ritmegevoel tussen mensen zijn groot. We weten nog niet welke "
"hersenmechanismen ten grondslag liggen aan deze verschillen. Door "
"vaardigheden in verschillende ritmetaakjes te meten, kunnen we testen welke "
"hersenprocessen belangrijk zijn voor ritmegevoel."
