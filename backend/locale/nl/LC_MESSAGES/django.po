"will be muted for a few seconds. Keep\n"
"    following along with the music in your head, until the music comes back. "
"Sometimes it will come back in the right\n"
"    place, but at other times, we will have skipped forward or backward "
"within the same piece of music during the\n"

"    recognise them, you will be asked whether you heard them before while "
"participating in the first phase of the\n"

"survey questions about your musical background\n"
