    """This is the working version of the Matching Pairs game for the 2025 Tunetwins experiment. The difference between this version and the original Matching Pairs game is that this version has some additional tutorial messages. These messages are intended to help the user understand the game. The tutorial messages are as follows:
    - no_match: This was not a match, so you get 0 points. Please try again to see if you can find a matching pair.
    - lucky_match: You got a matching pair, but you didn't hear both cards before. This is considered a lucky match. You get 10 points.
    - memory_match: You got a matching pair. You get 20 points.
    - misremembered: You thought you found a matching pair, but you didn't. This is considered a misremembered pair. You lose 10 points.

    The tutorial messages are displayed to the user in an overlay on the game screen.
