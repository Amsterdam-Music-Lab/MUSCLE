<p>You will be taking part in the Hooked on Music research project conducted by Dr John Ashley Burgoyne of the Music
    Cognition Group at the University of Amsterdam’s Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation. Before the research
    project can begin, it is important that you read about the procedures we will be applying. Make sure to read this
    information carefully.</p>

<h4>Purpose of the Research Project</h4>

<p>What makes music catchy? Why do some pieces of music come back to mind after we hear just a few notes and others not?
    Is there one ‘recipe’ for memorable music or does it depend on the person? And are there differences between what
    makes it easy to remember music for the long term and what makes it easy to remember music right now?</p>

<p>This project will help us answer these questions and better understand how we remember music both over the short term
    and the long term. Musical memories are fundamentally associated with developing our identities in adolescence, and
    even as other memories fade in old age, musical memories remain intact. Understanding musical memory better can help
    composers write new music, search engines find and recommend music their users will enjoy, and music therapists
    develop new approaches for working and living with memory disorders.</p>

<h4>Who Can Take Part in This Research?</h4>

<p>Anybody with sufficiently good hearing, natural or corrected, to enjoy music listening is welcome to participate in
    this research. Your device must be able to play audio, and you must have a sufficiently strong data connection to be
    able to stream short MP3 files. Headphones are recommended for the best results, but you may also use either
    internal or external loudspeakers. You should adjust the volume of your device so that it is comfortable for you.
</p>

<h4>Instructions and Procedure</h4>

<p>You will be presented with short fragments of music and asked whether you recognise them. Try to answer as quickly as
    you can, but only at the moment that you find yourself able to ‘sing along’ in your head. When you tell us that you
    recognise a piece of music, the music will keep playing, but the sound will be muted for a few seconds. Keep
    following along with the music in your head, until the music comes back. Sometimes it will come back in the right
    place, but at other times, we will have skipped forward or backward within the same piece of music during the
    silence. We will ask you whether you think the music came back in the right place or not. In between fragments, we
    will ask you some simple survey questions to better understand your musical background and how you engage with music
    in your daily life.</p>

<p>In a second phase of the experiment, you will also be presented with short fragments of music, but instead of being
    asked whether you recognise them, you will be asked whether you heard them before while participating in the first
    phase of the experiment. Again, in between these fragments, we will ask you simple survey questions about your
    musical background and how you engage with music in your daily life.</p>

<h4>Voluntary Participation</h4>

<p>You will be participating in this research project on a voluntary basis. This means you are free to stop taking part
    at any stage. This will not have any personal consequences and you will not be obliged to finish the procedures
    described above. You can also decide to withdraw your participation up to 8 days after the research has ended. If
    you decide to stop or withdraw your consent, all the information gathered up until then will be permanently deleted.
</p>

<h4>Discomfort, Risks, and Insurance</h4>

<p>The risks of participating in this research are no greater than in everyday situations at home. Previous experience
    in similar research has shown that no or hardly any discomfort is to be expected for participants. For all research
    at the University of Amsterdam, a standard liability insurance applies.</p>

<h4>Confidential Treatment of Your Details</h4>

<p>The information gathered over the course of this research will be used for further analysis and publication in
    scientific journals only. Fully anonymised data collected during the experiment (e.g., whether each musical fragment
    was recognised and how long it took) may be made available online in tandem with these scientific publications. Your
    personal details will not be used in these publications, and we guarantee that you will remain anonymous under all
    circumstances.</p>

<h4>Informed Consent</h4>

<p>I hereby declare that I have been clearly informed about the research project Hooked on Music at the University of
    Amsterdam, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, conducted by John Ashley Burgoyne as described above.</p>

<p>I consent to participate in this research on an entirely voluntary basis. I retain the right to revoke this consent
    without having to provide any reasons for my decision. I am aware that I am entitled to discontinue the research at
    any time and can withdraw my participation up to 8 days after the research has ended. If I decide to stop or
    withdraw my consent, all the information gathered up until then will be permanently deleted.</p>

<p>If my research results are used in scientific publications or made public in any other way, they will be fully
    anonymised. My personal information may not be viewed by third parties without my express permission.</p>
