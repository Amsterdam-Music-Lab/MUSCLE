class PracticeMixin(object):
    """PracticeMixin can be used to present a trial a given number of times.
    After these practice trials, it tests whether the partcipant performed well enough to proceed.

    Extend this class in your ruleset if you need a practice run for your participants.

    Note that you could use this class to
        - create rules for a self-contained block with only the practice run, and define the experiment proper in another rules file;
        - create rules which include the experiment proper after the practice phase.

    This practice class is now written towards 2 alternative forced choice rulesets, but may be extended in the future.

    Arguments:
        task_description (str): will appear in the title of the experiment
        first_condition (str): the first condition that trials may have (e.g., lower pitch)
        first_condition_i18n (str): the way the condition will appear to participants, can be translated if you use _() around the string
        second_condition (str): the second condition that trials may have (e.g., higher pitch)
        second_condition_i18n (str): the way the condition will appear to participants, can be translated if you use _() around the string
        n_practice_rounds (int): adjust to the number of practice rounds that should be presented
        n_practice_rounds_second_condition (int): how often the second condition appears in the practice rounds, e.g., one "catch" trial, or half the practice trials
        n_correct (int): how many answers of the participant need to be correct to proceed


    Example:
        This is an example of a rules file which would only present the practice run to the participant:
        ```python
        class MyPracticeRun(BaseRules, PracticeMixin):
            task_description = ""
            first_condition = 'lower'
            first_condition_i18n = _("LOWER")
            second_condition = 'higher'
            second_condition_i18n = _("HIGHER")
            n_practice_rounds = 10
            n_practice_rounds_second_condition = 5
            n_correct = 3

            def next_round(self, session):
                return self.next_practice_round(session)

        For a full-blown example, refer to the `duration_discrimination.py` rules file. This implements the experiment proper after the practice run.
