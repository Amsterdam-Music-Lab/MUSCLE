<p>{% blocktranslate %} You will be taking part in the experiment “Neural correlates of rhythmic abilities” conducted by Dr Atser Damsma of the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam. Before the research project can begin, it is important that you read about the procedures we will be applying. Make sure to read this information carefully. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Purpose of the Research Project" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} In the past you have participated in MRI-research from our research group and indicated that you would be interested in participating in future research. In the current study we will make use of the previously acquired MRI scans and will combine these scans with behavioral data which we will collect online. The current study therefore only entails a computer task.
The goal of this study is to investigate individual differences in rhythm perception. Rhythm is a fundamental aspect of music and musicality, yet there are large individual differences in rhythm perception abilities. The neural differences underlying these individual differences are not yet understood. By measuring performance in several rhythm tasks, we will be able to test which brain mechanisms are involved in rhythm perception. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Who Can Take Part in This Research?" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} Anybody aged 16 or older with no hearing problems is welcome to participate in this research. Your device must be able to play audio, and you must have a sufficiently strong data connection to be able to stream short sound files. Headphones are recommended for the best results, but you may also use either internal or external loudspeakers. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Instructions and Procedure" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} In this study, you will perform 8 short tasks related to rhythm. In each task, you will be presented with short fragments of music and rhythms, and you will be asked to make different types of judgements about the sounds. In addition, we will ask you some simple survey questions to better understand your musical background. It is important that you remain focused throughout the experiment and that you try not to move along with the sounds while performing the tasks. Before you start with each task, there will be an opportunity to practice to familiarize yourself with the task. The total duration of all tasks will be around 45 minutes and there will be multiple opportunities for you to take a break. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Voluntary Participation" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} There are no consequences if you decide now not to participate in this study. During the experiment, you are free to stop participating at any moment without giving a reason for doing so. {% endblocktranslate %}<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<h4>{% translate "Discomfort, Risks, and Insurance" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} For all research at the University of Amsterdam, a standard liability insurance applies. The UvA is legally obliged to inform the Dutch Tax Authority (“Belastingdienst”) about financial compensation for participants. You may receive a letter from the UvA with a payment overview and information about tax return. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Your privacy is guaranteed" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} Your personal information (about who you are) remains confidential and will not be shared without your explicit consent. Your research data will be analyzed by the researchers that collected the information. Research data published in scientific journals will be anonymous and cannot be traced back to you as an individual. Completely anonymized data can be made publicly accessible. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Compensation" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} As compensation for your participation, you receive 15 euros. To receive this compensation, make sure to register your participation on the lab.uva.nl website! {% endblocktranslate %}</span></p>
<h4>{% translate "Further Information" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} Should you have questions about this study at any given moment, please contact the responsible researcher, Dr. Atser Damsma (a.damsma@uva.nl). Formal complaints about this study can be addressed to the Ethics Review Board, Dr. Yair Pinto (y.pinto@uva.nl). For questions or complaints about the processing of your personal data you can also contact the data protection officer of the University of Amsterdam via fg@uva.nl. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Informed Consent" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} I hereby declare that: I have been clearly informed about the research project “Neural correlates of rhythmic abilities”, as described above; I am 16 or older; I have read and understand the information letter; I agree to participate in this study and I agree with the use of the data that are collected; I reserve the right to withdraw my participation from the study at any moment without providing any reason. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
