<p>{% blocktranslate %} Dear participant, {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} You will be taking part in a listening experiment by of Institute of Biology (IBL), Leiden University in collaboration with the Music Cognition Group (MCG) at the University of Amsterdamâ€™s Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation (ILLC). {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} <b>Before the research project can begin</b>, it is important that you read about the procedures we will be applying. Make sure to read this information carefully. The purpose of this research project is to understand better what listeners are listening to when they are listening to tone sequences as compared to songbirds. As such the current listening experiment is made to resemble the experiment that is currently also performed with zebra finches (a songbird). {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Who can take part in this research?" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} Anybody with sufficient good hearing, natural or corrected. Your device (computer, tablet or smartphone) must be able to play audio, and you must have a sufficiently strong internet connection to be able to stream short audio files. Headphones are recommended for the best results, but you may also use either internal or external loudspeakers. You should adjust the volume of your device so that it is comfortable for you. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Instructions and procedure" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} You will be presented with short sound sequences and will be asked whether you hear them as being one or another sequence. The listening task consists of two phases. In the first phase, you will hear two sequences that you have to answer as blue or orange. Once you have answer 8 out 10 stimuli correctly, you will go to the second part. In that part you will only occasionally get feedback on your responses. The whole task will take you approximately 20 minutes, and it should be completed in one go. Can you do better than zebra finches? Have fun! {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Discomfort, Risks & Insurance" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} The risks of participating in this research are no greater than in everyday situations at home. Previous experience in similar research has shown that no or hardly any discomfort is to be expected for participants. For all research at the University of Amsterdam (where the current online experiment is served), a standard liability insurance applies. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Confidential treatment of your details" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %} The information gathered over the course of this research will be used for further analysis and publication in scientific journals only. Fully anonymized data collected during the experiment (the age/gender, choices made, reaction time, etc.) may be made available online in tandem with these scientific publications. No personal details will be used in these publications, and we guarantee that you will remain anonymous under all circumstances. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
<h4>{% translate "Further Information" %}</h4>
