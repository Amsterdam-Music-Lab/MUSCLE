<p>
    {% blocktranslate %}
    You are about to take part in the ‘Cross-Linguistic Investigation of the Speech-to-Song Illusion’ research project
    conducted by Gustav-Hein Frieberg (MSc student) under supervision of Dr. Makiko Sadakata at the University of
    Amsterdam Musicology Department. Before the research project can begin, it is important that you read about the
    procedures we will be applying. Make sure to read the following information carefully.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
</p>
<h4>{% translate "Purpose of the research project" %}</h4>
<p>
    {% blocktranslate %}
    The Speech-to-Song Illusion is a perceptual illusion whereby the repetition of a speech segment induces a perceptual
    transformation from the impression of speech to the impression of signing. The present project aims at investigating
    the influence of linguistic experience upon the strength of the illusion.

</p>
<h4>{% translate "Instructions and procedure" %}</h4>
<p>
    {% blocktranslate %}
    The experiment will last about 10 minutes. After filling out a brief questionnaire inquiring about your age, gender,
    native language(s), and experience with three languages, you will be presented with short speech segments in those
    languages as well as short environmental sounds. Your task will be to rate each segment on a scale from 1 to 5 in
    terms of its musicality.

</p>
<h4>{% translate "Voluntary participation" %}</h4>
<p>
    {% blocktranslate %}
    You will be participating in this research project on a voluntary basis. This means you are free to stop taking part
    at any stage. This will not have any personal consequences and you will not be obliged to finish the procedures
    described above. You can also decide to withdraw your participation up to 8 days after the research has ended. If
    you decide to stop or withdraw your consent, all the information gathered up until then will be permanently deleted.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
</p>
<h4>{% translate "Discomfort, Risks & Insurance" %}</h4>
<p>
    {% blocktranslate %}
    The risks of participating in this research are no greater than in everyday situations at home. Previous experience
    in similar research has shown that no or hardly any discomfort is to be expected for participants. For all research
    at the University of Amsterdam, a standard liability insurance applies.
    {% endblocktranslate %}
</p>
<h4>{% translate "Confidential treatment of your details" %}</h4>
<p>
    {% blocktranslate %}
    The information gathered over the course of this research will be used for further analysis and publication in
    scientific journals only. No personal details will not be used in these publications, and we guarantee that you will
    remain anonymous under all circumstances.
    The data gathered during the research will be encrypted and stored separately from your personal details. These
    personal details and the encryption key are only accessible to members of the research staff.

<h4>{% translate "Reimbursement" %}</h4>
<p>
    {% blocktranslate %}
    There will not be any monetary reimbursement for taking part in the research project. If you wish, we can send you a
    summary of the general research results at a later stage.
