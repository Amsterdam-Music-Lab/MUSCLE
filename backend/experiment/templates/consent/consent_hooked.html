    You will be taking part in the {{experiment_title}} research project conducted by {{researcher}} of the
    Music Cognition Group at the University of Amsterdam’s Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation. Before the
    research project can begin, it is important that you read about the procedures we will be applying. Make sure to
    read this information carefully.

<h4>{% translate "Purpose of the research project" %}</h4>

<p>
    {% blocktranslate %}
    What makes music memorable? Why do we not only remember some pieces of music, but can also recall them after a long
    period of time, or even a few years later? What makes music remain in our memories for the long term? Are there some
    musical characters that make it easier to remember Chinese music in the long run or does it depend on a person? Do
    we collectively use the same features to recognize music?
    {% endblocktranslate %}
    </p>

<p> {% blocktranslate %} This project will help us answer these questions and better understand how we remember music
    over the long term.
    Musical memory could be affected by our listening history, listening experience, and the musical cultural where we
    grew up. Understanding musical memory can help streaming services to find and recommend music their users will
    enjoy, YouTubers and TikTokers to create new videos with the best choice of music, composers write new music, and
    music therapists develop new approaches for working and living with memory disorders.

<h4>{% translate "Who can take part in this research?" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktranslate %}
    Anybody with sufficiently good hearing, natural or corrected, to enjoy music listening is welcome to participate in
    this research. Your device must be able to play audio, and you must have a sufficiently strong data connection to be
    able to stream short MP3 files. Headphones are recommended for the best results, but you may also use either
    internal or external loudspeakers. You should adjust the volume of your device so that it is comfortable for you.

<h4>{% translate "Instructions and procedure" %}</h4>

<p>{% blocktranslate %}
    You will be presented with short fragments of music and asked whether you recognise them. Try to answer as quickly
    as
    you can, but only at the moment that you find yourself able to ‘sing along’ in your head. When you tell us that you
    recognise a piece of music, the music will keep playing, but the sound will be muted for a few seconds. Keep
    following along with the music in your head, until the music comes back. Sometimes it will come back in the right
    place, but at other times, we will have skipped forward or backward within the same piece of music during the
    silence. We will ask you whether you think the music came back in the right place or not. In between fragments, we
    will ask you some simple survey questions to better
    understand your musical background and how you engage with music in your daily life. In a second phase of the
    experiment, you will also be presented with short fragments of music, but instead of being asked whether you
    recognise them, you will be asked whether you heard them before while participating in the first phase of the
    experiment. Again, in between these fragments, we will ask you simple survey questions about your musical background
    and how you engage with music in your daily life.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

<h4>{% translate "Voluntary participation" %}</h4>

<p>{% blocktranslate %} You will be participating in this research project on a voluntary basis. This means you are free
    to stop taking part
    at any stage. This will not have any personal consequences and you will not be obliged to finish the procedures
    described above. You can also decide to withdraw your participation. If you decide to stop or withdraw your consent,
    all the information gathered up until then will be permanently deleted. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>

<h4>{% translate "Discomfort, Risks & Insurance" %}</h4>

<p>{% blocktranslate %} The risks of participating in this research are no greater than in everyday situations at home.
    Previous experience
    in similar research has shown that no or hardly any discomfort is to be expected for participants. For all research
    at the University of Amsterdam, a standard liability insurance applies. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>

<h4>{% translate "Confidential treatment of your details" %}</h4>

<p>{% blocktranslate %} The information gathered over the course of this research will be used for further analysis and
    publication in
    scientific journals only. Fully anonymised data collected during the experiment (e.g., whether each musical fragment
    was recognised and how long it took) may be made available online in tandem with these scientific publications. Your
    personal details will not be used in these publications, and we guarantee that you will remain anonymous under all
    circumstances. {% endblocktranslate %}</p>
