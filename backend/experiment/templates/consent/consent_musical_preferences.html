<h4>{% translate "Purpose of the research project" %}</h4>

<p>
{% blocktranslate %}
Studies have shown that cultural preferences and familiarity for music start in infancy and continue throughout adolescence and adulthood. People tend to prefer music from their own cultural traditions. This research will help us understand individual and situational influences on musical preferences and investigate the factors that underly musical preferences in China. For example, do people who have preferences for classical music also have preferences for Chinese traditional music? Are there cultural-specific or universal structural features for musical preferences?
