<p>You will be taking part in an experiment as part of the "Unravelling our capacity for music" project conducted by Jiaxin Li in collaboration with David John Baker, John Ashley Burgoyne, and Henkjan Honing from the Music Cognition Group (MCG) at the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam.</p>
<h4>Purpose of the Research Project</h4>
<p>As music cognition researchers, we are interested in the core cognitive components of musicality. The purpose of this project is to better understand what people are listening to when they are listening to music. Specifically, we want to know to what extent pitch plays a role in peopleâ€™s ability to remember familiar music. To do this, we have designed a music game that will allow us to answer questions about musical memory.</p>
<h4>Who Can Take Part?</h4>
<p> Anybody aged 16 or older with sufficient good hearing, natural or corrected, is welcome to participate. Your device (computer, tablet, or smartphone) must be able to play audio and stream short audio files online. You should adjust the volume of your device so that it is comfortable for you.</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>After answering some questions about your background, you will be presented with the game. You will see a set of cards on the screen. On each turn, you can click two cards to listen to the music.  Your task is to find all the matching music pairs. Each board either has pairs of identical music or pairs where one of the cards is distorted. If you find a match, you will be awarded points and that pair of cards will be removed from the game.  Try to earn more points by clearing the board in fewer turns. Each game will take a few minutes. You are welcome to play the game as many times as you like.</p>
<h4>Voluntary Participation and Risks</h4>
<p>Participating in this research is entirely voluntary. This means you are free to stop taking part in the experiment at any stage without consequences or penalty. Any data collected from this experiment will be stored in a way that it is not possible to personally identify unique individuals. We do not anticipate you will experience any risks or discomfort from participating in our experiment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
