<p>You will be taking part in the Hooked on music: TV Tunes research project conducted by Jiaxin Li in collaboration with John Ashley Burgoyne, Henkjan Honing and David John Baker at the University of Amsterdam, Logic, Language, and Computation (ILLC), Music Cognition Group (MCG). </p>
<h4 id="purpose-of-the-research-project">Purpose of the research project</h4>
<p>The purpose of this research project is to investigate the memorability of the TV tunes of popular/famous TV shows. TV tunes with a sufficient degree of familiarity/memorability will be selected to establish a suitable corpus for the following study. This research is the preliminary stage of a PhD project aimed at answering the question ‘what are we listening to when we listen to music?’ </p>
<h4 id="who-can-take-part-">Who can take part?</h4>
<p>Anybody aged 16 or older with sufficient good hearing, natural or corrected is welcome to participate in this experiment. Your device (computer, tablet or smartphone) must be able to play audio and stream short audio files online. You should adjust the volume of your device so that it is comfortable for you.  </p>
<h4 id="instructions">Instructions</h4>
<p>You will be presented with short fragments of TV tunes and asked whether you recognise them. Try to answer as quickly as you can, but only at the moment that you find yourself able to ‘singalong’ in your head. When you tell us that you recognise a piece of music, the music will keep playing, but the sound will be muted for a few seconds. Keep following along with the music in your head, until the music comes back. Sometimes it will come back in the right place, but at other times, we will have skipped forward or backward within the same piece of music during the silence. We will ask you whether you think the music came back in the right place or not. In between fragments, we will ask you some simple survey questions to better understand your musical background and how you engage with music in your daily life. In the second phase of the experiment, you will also be presented with short fragments of music, but instead of being asked whether you recognise them, you will be asked whether you heard them before while participating in the first phase of the experiment. </p>
<h4 id="voluntary-participation-risks">Voluntary participation & risks</h4>
